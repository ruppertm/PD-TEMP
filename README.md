# PD-TEMP

The aim of the PD-TEMP study is to investigate time interval reproduction in 19 Parkinson's disease patients and 10 healthy controls. 
We examined the ability to reproduce time intervals of 10 s in the presens of 1) a motory imagery task and 2) an auditory control task 
to investigate whether time reproduction deficits occur specifically in the context of movement. 

In addition, striato-cortical functional connectivity (resting-state fMRI) networks with a significant association to performance in the motor imagery task were 
elaborated and changes within the association (Group:task interaction) between connectivity and performance compared between groups.
